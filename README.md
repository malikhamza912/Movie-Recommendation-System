# 🤖 AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System

An AI-based project that applies **Collaborative Filtering** and **Machine Learning** techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences. The system leverages user-item interactions and similarity measures to deliver personalized recommendations.

## 📌 Features

- 🎬 Personalized movie recommendations
- 📊 Collaborative filtering using user-user and item-item similarity
- 🧠 Machine learning models for improved accuracy
- 📂 Dataset preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis
- 📈 Evaluation using accuracy metrics

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Programming:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Algorithms:** Collaborative Filtering, Cosine Similarity, Neural Networks

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Preprocess the dataset (ratings, movies, users)
2. Build similarity matrices (user-user, item-item)
3. Train ML models to enhance recommendation quality
4. Generate top-N movie suggestions for each user

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender.git
cd movie-recommender

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the model
python recommender.py
